# Test if help text is parsed correctly
mainmenu "Main menu"

    config HELP
        bool
        default y
        help
            This is a long help with and example of a command which should be parsed as is:

            espfuture.py --chip esp64 burn_linux

            The output should look like:

            Distro: {Fedora 42}

                * RAM: 64 MB
                * CPU: Triple core HTP
                ...
            Done.

            And this is the end.

    config JUST_CHECKING
        bool "Prompt"
        default y
        help
            Just checking if the parsing of previous help text really stopped.

    comment "If you see this in the output, the parsing (probably) succeeded."
