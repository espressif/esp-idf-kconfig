Overview
========

Kconfiglib is a Python 3 library and part of esp-idf-kconfig for parsing and extracting information
from Kconfig (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt)
configuration system.

Intro to symbol values
======================

Kconfiglib has the same assignment semantics as the C implementation.

Any symbol can be assigned a value by the user (via Kconfig.load_config() or
Symbol.set_value()), but this user value is only respected if the symbol is
visible, which corresponds to it (currently) being visible in the menuconfig
interface.

For symbols with prompts, the visibility of the symbol is determined by the
condition on the prompt. Symbols without prompts are never visible, so setting
a user value on them is pointless. A warning will be printed by default if
Symbol.set_value() is called on a promptless symbol. Assignments to promptless
symbols are normal within a .config file, so no similar warning will be printed
by load_config().

Dependencies from parents and 'if'/'depends on' are propagated to properties,
including prompts, so these two configurations are logically equivalent:

(1)

  menu "menu"
      depends on A

  if B

  config FOO
      bool "foo" if D
      default y
      depends on C

  endif

  endmenu

(2)

  menu "menu"
      depends on A

  config FOO
      bool "foo" if A && B && C && D
      default y if A && B && C

  endmenu

In this example, A && B && C && D (the prompt condition) needs to be non-n for
FOO to be visible (assignable).

'default' properties are independent of the visibility, though a 'default' will
often get the same condition as the prompt due to dependency propagation.
'default' properties are used if the symbol is not visible or has no user
value.

Symbols with no user value (or that have a user value but are not visible) and
no (active) 'default' default to n for bool symbols and to the empty
string for other symbol types.

'select' works similarly to symbol visibility, but sets a lower bound on the
value of the symbol. The lower bound is determined by the value of the
select*ing* symbol. 'select' does not respect visibility, so non-visible
symbols can be forced to a particular (minimum) value by a select as well.

Conditions on 'default' and 'select' work in mostly intuitive ways. If the
condition is n, the 'default' or 'select' is disabled.

When writing a configuration with Kconfig.write_config(), only symbols that are
visible, have an (active) default, or are selected will get written out (note
that this includes all symbols that would accept user values). Kconfiglib
matches the .config format produced by the C implementations down to the
character. This eases testing.

For a visible bool symbol FOO with value n, this line is written to
.config:

    # CONFIG_FOO is not set

The point is to remember the user n selection (which might differ from the
default value the symbol would get), while at the same sticking to the rule
that undefined corresponds to n (.config uses Makefile format, making the line
above a comment). When the .config file is read back in, this line will be
treated the same as the following assignment:

    CONFIG_FOO=n

In Kconfiglib, the set of (currently) assignable values for a bool
symbol appear in Symbol.assignable. For other symbol types, just check if
sym.visibility is 2 (y) to see whether the user value will have an
effect.


Intro to the menu tree
======================

The menu structure, as seen in e.g. menuconfig, is represented by a tree of
MenuNode objects. The top node of the configuration corresponds to an implicit
top-level menu, the title of which is shown at the top in the standard
menuconfig interface. (The title is also available in Kconfig.mainmenu_text in
Kconfiglib.)

The top node is found in Kconfig.top_node. From there, you can visit child menu
nodes by following the 'list' pointer, and any following menu nodes by
following the 'next' pointer. Usually, a non-None 'list' pointer indicates a
menu or Choice, but menu nodes for symbols can sometimes have a non-None 'list'
pointer too due to submenus created implicitly from dependencies.

MenuNode.item is either a Symbol or a Choice object, or one of the constants
MENU and COMMENT. The prompt of the menu node can be found in MenuNode.prompt,
which also holds the title for menus and comments. For Symbol and Choice,
MenuNode.help holds the help text (if any, otherwise None).

Most symbols will only have a single menu node. A symbol defined in multiple
locations will have one menu node for each location. The list of menu nodes for
a Symbol or Choice can be found in the Symbol/Choice.nodes attribute.

Note that prompts and help texts for symbols and choices are stored in their
menu node(s) rather than in the Symbol or Choice objects themselves. This makes
it possible to define a symbol in multiple locations with a different prompt or
help text in each location. To get the help text or prompt for a symbol with a
single menu node, do sym.nodes[0].help and sym.nodes[0].prompt, respectively.
The prompt is a (text, condition) tuple, where condition determines the
visibility (see 'Intro to expressions' below).

This organization mirrors the C implementation. MenuNode is called
'struct menu' there, but I thought "menu" was a confusing name.

It is possible to give a Choice a name and define it in multiple locations,
hence why Choice.nodes is also a list.

As a convenience, the properties added at a particular definition location are
available on the MenuNode itself, in e.g. MenuNode.defaults. This is helpful
when generating documentation, so that symbols/choices defined in multiple
locations can be shown with the correct properties at each location.


Intro to expressions
====================

Expressions can be evaluated with the expr_value() function and printed with
the expr_str() function (these are used internally as well). Evaluating an
expression always yields a bool value, where n and y are represented as
0 and 2. Value of 1 is skipped for compatibility with the original Kconfiglib,
where there was a third state (m) for kernel modules, which is not needed nor supported
in esp-idf-kconfig.

The following table should help you figure out how expressions are represented.
A, B, C, ... are symbols (Symbol instances), NOT is the kconfiglib.NOT
constant, etc.

Expression            Representation
----------            --------------
A                     A
"A"                   A (constant symbol)
!A                    (NOT, A)
A && B                (AND, A, B)
A && B && C           (AND, A, (AND, B, C))
A || B                (OR, A, B)
A || (B && C && D)    (OR, A, (AND, B, (AND, C, D)))
A = B                 (EQUAL, A, B)
A != "foo"            (UNEQUAL, A, foo (constant symbol))
A && B = C && D       (AND, A, (AND, (EQUAL, B, C), D))
n                     Kconfig.n (constant symbol)
y                     Kconfig.y (constant symbol)
"y"                   Kconfig.y (constant symbol)

Strings like "foo" in 'default "foo"' or 'depends on SYM = "foo"' are
represented as constant symbols, so the only values that appear in expressions
are symbols***. This mirrors the C implementation.

***For choice symbols, the parent Choice will appear in expressions as well,
but it's usually invisible as the value interfaces of Symbol and Choice are
identical. This mirrors the C implementation and makes different choice modes
"just work".

Manual evaluation examples:

  - The value of A && B is min(A.bool_value, B.bool_value)

  - The value of A || B is max(A.bool_value, B.bool_value)

  - The value of !A is 2 - A.bool_value

  - The value of A = B is 2 (y) if A.str_value == B.str_value, and 0 (n)
    otherwise. Note that str_value is used here instead of bool_value.

    For constant (as well as undefined) symbols, str_value matches the name of
    the symbol. This mirrors the C implementation and explains why
    'depends on SYM = "foo"' above works as expected.

n/y are automatically converted to the corresponding constant symbols
"n"/"y" (Kconfig.n/y) during parsing.

Kconfig.const_syms is a dictionary like Kconfig.syms but for constant symbols.

If a condition is missing (e.g., <cond> when the 'if <cond>' is removed from
'default A if <cond>'), it is actually Kconfig.y. The standard __str__()
functions just avoid printing 'if y' conditions to give cleaner output.


Kconfig extensions
==================

Kconfiglib includes a couple of Kconfig extensions:

'source' with relative path
---------------------------

The 'rsource' statement sources Kconfig files with a path relative to directory
of the Kconfig file containing the 'rsource' statement, instead of relative to
the project root.

Consider following directory tree:

  Project
  +--Kconfig
  |
  +--src
     +--Kconfig
     |
     +--SubSystem1
        +--Kconfig
        |
        +--ModuleA
           +--Kconfig

In this example, assume that src/SubSystem1/Kconfig wants to source
src/SubSystem1/ModuleA/Kconfig.

With 'source', this statement would be used:

  source "src/SubSystem1/ModuleA/Kconfig"

With 'rsource', this turns into

  rsource "ModuleA/Kconfig"

If an absolute path is given to 'rsource', it acts the same as 'source'.

'rsource' can be used to create "position-independent" Kconfig trees that can
be moved around freely.


Globbing 'source'
-----------------

'source' and 'rsource' accept glob patterns, sourcing all matching Kconfig
files. They require at least one matching file, raising a KconfigError
otherwise.

For example, the following statement might source sub1/foofoofoo and
sub2/foobarfoo:

  source "sub[12]/foo*foo"

The glob patterns accepted are the same as for the standard glob.glob()
function.

Two additional statements are provided for cases where it's acceptable for a
pattern to match no files: 'osource' and 'orsource' (the o is for "optional").

For example, the following statements will be no-ops if neither "foo" nor any
files matching "bar*" exist:

  osource "foo"
  osource "bar*"

'orsource' does a relative optional source.

'source' and 'osource' are analogous to 'include' and '-include' in Make.


Extra optional warnings
-----------------------

Some optional warnings can be controlled via environment variables:

  - KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF: If set to 'y', warnings will be generated for all
    references to undefined symbols within Kconfig files. The only gotcha is
    that all hex literals must be prefixed with "0x" or "0X", to make it
    possible to distinguish them from symbol references.

    Some projects (e.g. the Linux kernel) use multiple Kconfig trees with many
    shared Kconfig files, leading to some safe undefined symbol references.
    KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF is useful in projects that only have a single Kconfig
    tree though.

    KCONFIG_STRICT is an older alias for this environment variable, supported
    for backwards compatibility.

  - KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF_ASSIGN: If set to 'y', warnings will be generated for
    all assignments to undefined symbols within .config files. By default, no
    such warnings are generated.

    This warning can also be enabled/disabled via the Kconfig.warn_assign_undef
    variable.


Preprocessor user functions defined in Python
---------------------------------------------

Preprocessor functions can be defined in Python, which makes it simple to
integrate information from existing Python tools into Kconfig (e.g. to have
Kconfig symbols depend on hardware information stored in some other format).

Putting a Python module named kconfigfunctions(.py) anywhere in sys.path will
cause it to be imported by Kconfiglib (in Kconfig.__init__()). Note that
sys.path can be customized via PYTHONPATH, and includes the directory of the
module being run by default, as well as installation directories.

If the KCONFIG_FUNCTIONS environment variable is set, it gives a different
module name to use instead of 'kconfigfunctions'.

The imported module is expected to define a global dictionary named 'functions'
that maps function names to Python functions, as follows:

  def my_fn(kconf, name, arg_1, arg_2, ...):
      # kconf:
      #   Kconfig instance
      #
      # name:
      #   Name of the user-defined function ("my-fn"). Think argv[0].
      #
      # arg_1, arg_2, ...:
      #   Arguments passed to the function from Kconfig (strings)
      #
      # Returns a string to be substituted as the result of calling the
      # function
      ...

  def my_other_fn(kconf, name, arg_1, arg_2, ...):
      ...

  functions = {
      "my-fn":       (my_fn,       <min.args>, <max.args>/None),
      "my-other-fn": (my_other_fn, <min.args>, <max.args>/None),
      ...
  }

  ...

<min.args> and <max.args> are the minimum and maximum number of arguments
expected by the function (excluding the implicit 'name' argument). If
<max.args> is None, there is no upper limit to the number of arguments. Passing
an invalid number of arguments will generate a KconfigError exception.

Functions can access the current parsing location as kconf.filename/linenr.
Accessing other fields of the Kconfig object is not safe. See the warning
below.

Keep in mind that for a variable defined like 'foo = $(fn)', 'fn' will be
called only when 'foo' is expanded. If 'fn' uses the parsing location and the
intent is to use the location of the assignment, you want 'foo := $(fn)'
instead, which calls the function immediately.

Once defined, user functions can be called from Kconfig in the same way as
other preprocessor functions:

    config FOO
        ...
        depends on $(my-fn,arg1,arg2)

If my_fn() returns "n", this will result in

    config FOO
        ...
        depends on n

Warning
*******

User-defined preprocessor functions are called as they're encountered at parse
time, before all Kconfig files have been processed, and before the menu tree
has been finalized. There are no guarantees that accessing Kconfig symbols or
the menu tree via the 'kconf' parameter will work, and it could potentially
lead to a crash.

Preferably, user-defined functions should be stateless.

        Creates a new Kconfig object by parsing Kconfig files.
        Note that Kconfig files are not the same as .config files (which store
        configuration symbol values).

        See the module docstring for some environment variables that influence
        default warning settings (KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF and
        KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF_ASSIGN).

        Raises KconfigError on syntax/semantic errors, and OSError or (possibly
        a subclass of) IOError on IO errors ('errno', 'strerror', and
        'filename' are available). Note that IOError is an alias for OSError on
        Python 3, so it's enough to catch OSError there.

        filename (default: "Kconfig"):
          The Kconfig file to load. For the Linux kernel, you'll want "Kconfig"
          from the top-level directory, as environment variables will make sure
          the right Kconfig is included from there (arch/$SRCARCH/Kconfig as of
          writing).

          If $srctree is set, 'filename' will be looked up relative to it.
          $srctree is also used to look up source'd files within Kconfig files.

          If you are using Kconfiglib via 'make scriptconfig', the filename of
          the base base Kconfig file will be in sys.argv[1]. It's currently
          always "Kconfig" in practice.

        warn (default: True):
          True if warnings related to this configuration should be generated.
          This can be changed later by setting Kconfig.warn to True/False. It
          is provided as a constructor argument since warnings might be
          generated during parsing.

          See the other Kconfig.warn_* variables as well, which enable or
          suppress certain warnings when warnings are enabled.

          All generated warnings are added to the Kconfig.warnings list.

        warn_to_stderr (default: True):
          True if warnings should be printed to stderr in addition to being
          added to Kconfig.warnings.

          This can be changed later by setting Kconfig.warn_to_stderr to
          True/False.

        encoding (default: "utf-8"):
          The encoding to use when reading and writing files, and when decoding
          output from commands run via $(shell). If None, the encoding
          specified in the current locale will be used.

          The "utf-8" default avoids exceptions on systems that are configured
          to use the C locale, which implies an ASCII encoding.

          Helper for tools. When True, any EnvironmentError or KconfigError
          generated during parsing is caught, the exception message is printed
          to stderr together with the command name, and sys.exit(1) is called
          (which generates SystemExit).

          This hides the Python traceback for "expected" errors like syntax
          errors in Kconfig files.

          Other exceptions besides EnvironmentError and KconfigError are still
          propagated when suppress_traceback is True.

        Kconfig.missing_syms as well.

        See the Kconfig.__init__() docstring for raised exceptions

          (if any) is calculated automatically, giving the behavior you'd
          usually want:

            1. If the KCONFIG_CONFIG environment variable is set, it gives the
               path to the configuration file to load. Otherwise, ".config" is
               used. See standard_config_filename().

            2. If the path from (1.) doesn't exist, the configuration file
               given by kconf.defconfig_filename is loaded instead, which is
               derived from the 'option defconfig_list' symbol.

            3. If (1.) and (2.) fail to find a configuration file to load, no
               configuration file is loaded, and symbols retain their current
               values (e.g., their default values). This is not an error.

           See the return value as well.

        replace (default: True):
          If True, all existing user values will be cleared before loading the
          .config. Pass False to merge configurations.

        verbose (default: None):
          Limited backwards compatibility to prevent crashes. A warning is
          printed if anything but None is passed.

          Prior to Kconfiglib 12.0.0, this option enabled printing of messages
          to stdout when 'filename' was None. A message is (always) returned
          now instead, which is more flexible.

          Will probably be removed in some future version.

        Returns a string with a message saying which file got loaded (or
        possibly that no file got loaded, when 'filename' is None). This is
        meant to reduce boilerplate in tools, which can do e.g.
        print(kconf.load_config()). The returned message distinguishes between
        loading (replace == True) and merging (replace == False).

          Errors are silently ignored if <filename>.old cannot be written (e.g.
          due to being a directory, or <filename> being something like
          /dev/null).

        verbose (default: None):
          Limited backwards compatibility to prevent crashes. A warning is
          printed if anything but None is passed.

          Prior to Kconfiglib 12.0.0, this option enabled printing of messages

        Tip: This field is useful when generating custom configuration output,

          Note that the value for an int/hex symbol is passed as a string, e.g.
          "123" or "0x0123". The format of this string is preserved in the

    # Algorithm:
    #
    #  1. Symbols/choices start out with _visited = 0, meaning unvisited.
    #
    #  2. When a symbol/choice is first visited, _visited is set to 1, meaning
    #     "visited, potentially part of a dependency loop". The recursive
    #     search then continues from the symbol/choice.
    #
    #  3. If we run into a symbol/choice X with _visited already set to 1,
    #     there's a dependency loop. The loop is found on the call stack by
    #     recording symbols while returning ("on the way back") until X is seen
    #     again.
    #
    #  4. Once a symbol/choice and all its dependencies (or dependents in this
    #     case) have been checked recursively without detecting any loops, its
    #     _visited is set to 2, meaning "visited, not part of a dependency
    #     loop".
    #
    #     This saves work if we run into the symbol/choice again in later calls
    #     to _check_dep_loop_sym(). We just return immediately.
    #
    # Choices complicate things, as every choice symbol depends on every other
    # choice symbol in a sense. When a choice is "entered" via a choice symbol
    # X, we visit all choice symbols from the choice except X, and prevent
    # immediately revisiting the choice with a flag (ignore_choice).

    # Maybe there's a better way to handle this (different flags or the
